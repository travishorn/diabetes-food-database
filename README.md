# Diabetes Food Database

Food information for people with diabetes. Visit the website at _TBD_ and search for a food item.

## Contributing

Work is being done now to convert the database to a SQL-driven design. Once it is ready,
contributions for food items will be greatly appreciated.

Necessary food items properties will include:

- **name** - The name of the food. Will be used for searching. Must be unique, singular (smoothie
  instead smoothies) and all lowercase (carrot instead of Carrot).
- **displayName** - A prettier name of the food. If the name is sugar, the displayName might be
  Sugar (with capitalization).
- **alternateNames** - An array of names people might also use when searching for this food. Should
  also be singular and all lowercase.
- **level** - A number from 1 to 5.
  - 1 = Avoid - Diabetic people should stay away from this food.
  - 2 = Caution - This food can be eaten in moderation or under certain conditions.
  - 3 = Okay - Neutral. No significant positive or negative health effects.
  - 4 = Good - Food that is good for a diabetic person to eat.
  - 5 = Great - Foods at this level are among the healthiest options.
- **explanation** - A reason why this food is or is not healthy.
- **suggestions** - Actions to take regarding this food. Alternatives to this food if it is
  unhealthy.
